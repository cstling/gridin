# gridin
A 2D grid library for Odin, with support for "Bring-Your-Own-Implementation" pathfinding and visibility.

NOTE: I'm not currently maintaining this repository, in favor of working on a different one which includes multiple game components. Though if you're dead-set on using this, feel free to contact me if you need help.
